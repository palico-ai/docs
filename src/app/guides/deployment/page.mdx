# Deployment

Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Palico.

## Quickstart

In this section, we'll make your codebase docker-ready and run it locally with docker-compose.

### Step 1: Generate Selfhosting Files

From the root of your application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run selfhost:init
```

This will add a docker folder to your project with the following files:

```
selfhost/
  Dockerfile
  docker-compose.yml
  template.env
```

<Note>
We only need to run this command once. You should commit these files to your repository at this point.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initialized Self-Hosted Docker Setup"
```
</Note>

### Step 2: Create `.env` file
```bash
cp selfhost/template.env selfhost/.env
```
You should now have a `.env` file in your `selfhost` directory. You should modify this file with appropriate values when deploying to production. Read more in the Setting your env file [section](#setting-up-your-env-file).

### Step 3: Make sure Docker Images are up-to-date
```bash
npm run selfhost:update
```
You should always run this command before deploying your application to production. This will ensure that your Docker images are up-to-date.

### Step 4: Start your Docker Container
```bash
npm run selfhost:up -- -d
```
This will start your Docker container in the background. You can access Palico Studio `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 5: Make sure your Database is up-to-date
```bash
npm run palico selfhost migrate-db -- --user root --password root
```

You should always run this command before deploying your application to production. This will ensure that your database is up-to-date.


## Setting up your `.env` file
It's essential to update the following values in your `.env` file before deploying to production:
```bash
DOCKER_COMPOSE_JWT_SECRET
DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_KEY
DOCKER_COMPOSE_STUDIO_USERNAME
DOCKER_COMPOSE_STUDIO_PASSWORD
```
